Our HR analytics dashboard, designed using Power BI, is specifically aimed to find out the reasons for increasing attrition rate. It provides a comprehensive and user-friendly view of key HR metrics such as turnover rate, headcount, and employee engagement, with a specific focus on identifying the factors that are contributing to the high attrition rate. The dashboard allows HR professionals and managers to easily track and analyze data on employee performance, demographics, and compensation, as well as measure employee satisfaction and engagement levels. With interactive visualizations and drill-down capabilities, users can quickly identify patterns and trends in the data, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to improve the overall performance and productivity of the organization by reducing the attrition rate.
